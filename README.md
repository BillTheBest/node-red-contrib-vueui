# node-red-contrib-vueui

A Node-RED UI template based on Vue.js

Designed as a simpler (for developers) alternative to the Node-RED Dashboard. Whereas Dashboard is great for creating a zero-code UI, it achieves
that at the cost of behind-the-scenes complexity.

Instead, this uses the much simpler Vue.js framework and a simple configuration and single template node so you need to know some HTML at least
and you will need to know a bit about Vue.js. But you should be able to use this to build anything you want to. Effectively, each instance of
this node will create a new single-page app.

## Pre-requisites

VueUI requires Node-RED version 0.16 or more recent. It uses Vue.JS v2.

## Install

Run the following command in your Node-RED user directory (typically `~/.node-red`):

```
npm install node-red-contrib-vueui
```

Open your Node-RED instance and you should have VueUI nodes available in the palette. The UI interface is available at <http://localhost:1880/vue> 
(if default Node-RED and node settings are used).
